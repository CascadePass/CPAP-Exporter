# CPAP Exporter

CPAP Exporter is a flexible, open-source tool that helps users extract and analyze data from CPAP or BiPAP machines. It reads the files saved on the device's SD card and exports the data into **CSV files**, with planned support for **XML**, **JSON**, and other formats in the future.

The application features a **simple, intuitive user interface** that guides users through selecting:
- Which signals to export (e.g., flow rate, leak rate, pressure, etc.).
- Specific nights to pull data from.
- Output preferences (e.g., single file or multiple files).

This level of customization makes it easier for users to analyze their data in tools like Excel or share it with medical professionals. While there are other tools for CPAP data export, none match CPAP Exporterâ€™s flexibility and ease of use.

## Features
- Extracts CPAP/BiPAP data and exports it as CSV files.
- (Planned support for XML, JSON, and more).
- Resample high resolution signals like *Mask Pressure* as needed, allowing users to export any data available in the EDF files.
- Analyzes wave form data to find periods when the user didn't fully stop breathing, but did not breathe well.
- Open source, free to use, with no ads or data collection.
